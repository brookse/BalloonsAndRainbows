# Balloons and Rainbows

![Balloons and Rainbows](https://github.com/brookse/BalloonsAndRainbows/blob/master/header.png)<br>

Balloons and Rainbows is a web-hosted recreation of an old DOS game made by [Lyzzi Brooks](https://twitter.com/Lyzzi_Lightyear) using [Phaser.io](http://phaser.io/).

> From the manual:

> This program draws a balloon and sounds a tone when any key is hit. The balloons are a random size and color and are drawn at random locations on the screen. Each key is assigned a different tone (the user can play tunes by pressing the appropriate keys).

> Hitting the down-arrow key causes the balloon to shrink until it disappears.

> Hitting the up-arrow key causes the balloon to grow until it pops. After the pop, a rainbow is drawn and the first phrase of "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" is played.

Current implementation:
- Press R, G, Y, W, B, P, and O to create red, green, yellow, white, blue, pink, and orange balloons (respectively).
- Pressing any other letter keys will create a randomly colored balloon.
- Press UP to inflate the balloon.
